        You are protected, in short, by your ability to love! The only
        protection that can possibly work against the lure of power like
        Voldemort's! In spite of all the temptation you have endured, all the
        suffering, you remain pure of heart, just as pure as you were at the age
        of eleven, when you stared into a mirror that reflected your heart's
        desire, and it showed you only the way to thwart Lord Voldemort, and not
        immortality or riches. Harry, have you any idea how few wizards could
        have seen what you saw in that mirror?" — Albus Dumbledore describing
        Harry's rare nature

        Harry Potter: "But why's she got to go to the library?" Ronald Weasley:

        "I'm the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I got a
        lot to live up to. Bill and Charlie have already left — Bill was Head
        Boy and Charlie was captain of Quidditch. Now Percy's a prefect. Fred
        and George mess around a lot, but they still get really good marks and
        everyone thinks they're really funny. Everyone expects me to do as well
        as the others, but if I do, it's no big deal, because they did it
        first." — Ron's family and other's expectation
